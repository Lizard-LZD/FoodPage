The application should have the following features:
•	A header section that displays the title of the page and a search bar to filter the list of items by name or any other attribute.
•	A section that displays a list of items fetched from an API endpoint using Axios or any other HTTP client. The list of items should include at least the following information: id, name, description, image.
•	A sort functionality that allows the user to sort the list of items by name, id, or any other attribute.
•	A form to add new items to the list. The form should have fields for at least name, description, and image.
•	The application should be written in TypeScript for type safety.
